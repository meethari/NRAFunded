There is a lot of political data out there about issues that people care about,
but it is usuallly not formatted in a way that is easy to access.

Especially when it comes to lobbying and campaign funding, while politicians
are required to disclose the money they receive, they have clear incentive to
make this information difficult to find and use.

Our website does what the internet does best, it finds information, reorganizes it
in a meaningful way, and then distributes it.

Our application makes information about where candidates get money from easier
to find and compare. In light of recent events, we decided to focus on money
received from the NRA, although this project would be very scalable to other
types of funding.
