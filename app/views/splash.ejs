        Every year the National Rifle Association spends millions of dollars lobbying members of Congress. In 2017 alone the NRA spent over $4.1 million lobbying gun rights. Although it is required by law for this information to be public, it is not usually presented in a easily accessible manner.

            <div id="aboutPartTwo">"Mass shootings are not inevitable. The majority of Americans support common sense gun reform. Though we feel angry, heartbroken, even helpless now, we have the power to elect people who will protect lives, not gun sellersâ€™ profits. Remember these feelings in November, and VOTE." - Hillary Clinton (16 February 2018)</div>
